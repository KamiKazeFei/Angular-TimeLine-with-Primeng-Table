# Description
This is a very simple Angular component. 
I have created a basic timeline functionality using the PrimeNG Table package. 
The operation is straightforward - you just need to determine the starting point, drag the mouse, and release it to create a time event. 
It also provides the ability to define custom event handling. 
Due to the unique nature of PrimeNG Table, 
I opted for a more complex approach. The main logic involves creating multiple '<div>' blocks within each '<td>' and adjusting the CSS styles of both the table and the divs with each operation.
